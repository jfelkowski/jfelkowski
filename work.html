    <p>After graduating high school from <em>Scranton Preparatory School</em>, I went on to attain my Bachelor's Degree in Communication and Media Studies from <em>The University of Scranton</em>. Upon entry into the real world, I arrived at the local PBS affiliate, <em>WVIA</em>. I quickly moved from various roles as Production Assistant to having complete creative control as Director, Videographer & Editor over a variety of programs fit for television broadcast and digital distribution. Types of productions included:</p>
    <ul id="contentlist">
      <li>60 minute documentaries - historical/biographical</li>
      <li>30 minute programs - arts & performance/educational</li>
      <li>Digital shorts</li>
      <li>Reality TV</li>
      <li>Trailers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Following my experiences at <em>WVIA</em>, I spent a few years as a News Photographer/Editor at the local ABC afiliate, <em>WNEP</em>. It is here where I truly experienced the value of time mangagement and teamwork, collaborating on stories under pressing deadlines that impacted my local community.</p>

    <p>After my adventures in media, I transitioned to Sales in the automobile industry, working for one of the top 5 Toyota dealerships in the Northeast United States. My dream car is a 68' Corvette Stingray.</p>
